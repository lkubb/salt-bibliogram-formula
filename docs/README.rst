General notes
-------------

See the full `SaltStack Formulas installation and usage instructions
<https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html>`_.

If you are interested in writing or contributing to formulas, please pay attention to the `Writing Formula Section
<https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html#writing-formulas>`_.

If you want to use this formula, please pay attention to the ``FORMULA`` file and/or ``git tag``,
which contains the currently released version. This formula is versioned according to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.

See `Formula Versioning Section <https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html#versioning>`_ for more details.

If you need (non-default) configuration, please refer to:

- `how to configure the formula with map.jinja <map.jinja.rst>`_
- the ``pillar.example`` file
- the `Special notes`_ section

Special notes
-------------
* This formula is written with the custom `compose modules <https://github.com/lkubb/salt-podman-formula>`_ in mind and will not work without them.

Configuration
-------------
An example pillar is provided, please see `pillar.example`. Note that you do not need to specify everything by pillar. Often, it's much easier and less resource-heavy to use the ``parameters/<grain>/<value>.yaml`` files for non-sensitive settings. The underlying logic is explained in `map.jinja`.

Available states
----------------

.. contents::
   :local:

``bibliogram``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

This installs the bibliogram composition,
manages the bibliogram configuration and then
starts the associated service.

``bibliogram.package``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will install the bibliogram composition only.

``bibliogram.config``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will configure the bibliogram containers and has a dependency on ``bibliogram.install``
via include list.

``bibliogram.service``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will start the bibliogram container services and has a dependency on ``bibliogram.config``
via include list.

``bibliogram.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

This state will undo everything performed in the ``bibliogram`` meta-state in reverse order, i.e.
stops the services,
removes the configurations and
then uninstalls the composition.

``bibliogram.service.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will stop the bibliogram service and disable it at boot time.

``bibliogram.config.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will remove the configuration of the bibliogram composition and has a
dependency on ``bibliogram.service.clean`` via include list.

``bibliogram.package.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will remove the bibliogram composition and has a depency on
``bibliogram.config.clean`` via include list.

Contributing to this repo
-------------------------

Commit messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Commit message formatting is significant!**

Please see `How to contribute <https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for more details.

pre-commit
^^^^^^^^^^

`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ is configured for this formula, which you may optionally use to ease the steps involved in submitting your changes.
First install  the ``pre-commit`` package manager using the appropriate `method <https://pre-commit.com/#installation>`_, then run ``bin/install-hooks`` and
now ``pre-commit`` will run automatically on each ``git commit``. ::

  $ bin/install-hooks
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/commit-msg

State documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a script that semi-autodocuments available states: ``bin/slsdoc``.

If a ``.sls`` file begins with a Jinja comment, it will dump that into the docs. It can be configured differently depending on the formula. See the script source code for details currently.

This means if you feel a state should be documented, make sure to write a comment explaining it.

Testing
-------

Linux testing is done with ``kitchen-salt``.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Ruby
* Docker

.. code-block:: bash

   $ gem install bundler
   $ bundle install
   $ bin/kitchen test [platform]

Where ``[platform]`` is the platform name defined in ``kitchen.yml``,
e.g. ``debian-9-2019-2-py3``.

``bin/kitchen converge``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates the docker instance and runs the ``bibliogram`` main state, ready for testing.

``bin/kitchen verify``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs the ``inspec`` tests on the actual instance.

``bin/kitchen destroy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removes the docker instance.

``bin/kitchen test``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. ``destroy`` + ``converge`` + ``verify`` + ``destroy``.

``bin/kitchen login``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
